# vue-dx-porto

This is the code for the talk [Vue 3 Developer Experience](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NnC7bFFjFd3grAxe-SP9v-Y4Cy9a3M1EUscjBJgPRDk/edit?usp=sharing). Meant to show the future for vue ecosystem.


## Experimental

This relies on experimental and not production ready tools. 



## Extensions VSCode

This relies on [vue-developer-experience](https://github.com/znck/vue-developer-experience) by @znck 

- [Vue](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=znck.vue) - Vue language grammar and syntax highlight. Made with ðŸ’š for Vue Developers. - **Preview**
- [Vue Language Features (Insiders)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=znck.vue-language-features-insiders)



## Limitations

Currently the build is not doing a typecheck it seems [typescript-plugin-vue](typescript-plugin-vue) is not working as expected, once that works the `shim.d.ts` file should be removed.
